I built [HNSSearch](https://hnssearch.io/). The frontend is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/hnssearch/hnssearch-frontend).

### What will you be building? Why is that a valuable open source contribution to Handshake?

A while back, I intended to develop a feedback platform named FeedbackForge, but I couldn't complete it and ended up discarding the initial codebase. I plan to build it now, creating a platform akin to [fider.io](https://fider.io/). However, this platform will uniquely offer a Handshake name login mechanism. This contribution would enable Handshake projects to effortlessly collect feedback or bug reports and engage with their communities, negating the need to fuss over user management setup. In the upcoming platform, users will be empowered to deploy their own feedback boards, ensuring they maintain complete control. For ease of deployment, a Docker image will be made available. Furthermore, the entire codebase will be open-sourced to promote transparency and community involvement. 

I could consider offering a hosted version as a potential future enhancement (if desired or needed). This would enable users to simply register, create a board, and get started, eliminating the need for individual deployment.

### What are the completion criteria?

The project would be considered complete upon the availability of the first build. Essentially, once the platform's basic version is deployable by users and the Handshake login feature is functional.

---

### When will this be completed? (max 4 weeks)

From the moment I begin, I anticipate the project will take between 3 to 4 weeks to complete.
